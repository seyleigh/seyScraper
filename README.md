This site scrapes a news page from The Denver Post. User can save articles for later and delete them as well from the Mongo datatbase.

### Struggles faced:
I had THE hardest time trying to find the correct paths to scrape things. I still only get like 5 or 6 articles so I'm not sure if thats all there is on the page or if I still didn't find the best scraping path. Also I ABSOLUTELY loathe handlebars.
